main insight:  
1 HFD data for Japan starts in AP squares
2 They convert (period -> cohort) by allocating births (and computing rates) for Lexis triangles
3 We can almost replicate the (period -> cohort) process by averaging F-hat(c) and F-hat(c+1)

The main point is that the HFD *already* has a model to follow for constructing cohort rates from AP rectangles,
and it involves using the "AP diagonals" for both cohorts c and c+1. In many cases (including for Japan) this is a necessary step for calculating cohort rates. Births and birth rates from AP squares are separated into Lexis triangles, which are then reassembled into age-cohort parallelograms and summaries like completed fertility. 

"Taking the diagonals" as in van Raalte et al. uses only part of the data (the cohort-c diagonal) and most of the error in their illustration arises from that.
